# Correlation-and-Data-Cleaning-Python-Project
This project was my first ever data analysis project using Python and it served as a guided learning opportunity to practice Python, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis skills.
Using a movie dataset, I explored the relationships between different variables — such as budget, gross revenue, and ratings — while applying real-world data cleaning and visualization techniques

 Skills & Tools Learned

		Python: Data manipulation and analysis
     	Pandas: Loading, cleaning, and exploring datasets
		NumPy: Working with numerical data
	    Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization and styling
	    Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps, scatter plots, and statistical relationships
 	    Data Cleaning Techniques:
	    Handling missing data
 	    Removing duplicates
	    Converting data types
	    Renaming columns

 Key Insights

	    Identified strong correlations between a movie’s budget and its gross revenue.
		Explored how ratings and votes relate to box office performance.
		Learned how outliers can influence correlation results.
